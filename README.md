# Natural Language Processing(NLP) :  
## Definition :  
NLP is a way of computers to understand, interpret and manipulate human language.  
## Components Of NLP :   
-   Morphological and Lexical Analysis
-   Syntactic Analysis
-   Semantic Analysis
-   Discourse Integration
-   Pragmatic Analysis  
## Text Processing :  
-   Word extraction  
-   Stopwords removal  
-   Stemming/Lemmatization  
-   Frequency counts / TF-IDF  
## Producing word embeddings using Word2Vec  
  ### Word Embeddings:  
  When working with text in machine learning models, we need to convert strings into numbers in order to do calculations  
  with them. Word embeddings provides an efficient way by representing similar words with similar numbers/vectors.

  #### Definition of embedding in google glossary :  
  A categorical feature represented as a continuous-valued feature. Typically, an embedding is a translation of a high-dimensional vector   into a low-dimensional space

## Text Classification using NLTK  
NLTK stands for Natural Language Tool Kit.It is a tool for teaching, and working in, computational linguistics using Python.

### Text Classification Applications :  
-   Recommending  
-   Spam filtering  
-   Personalized news  
-   Email routing  
-   Email prioritizing  
### Required processes :  
-   Word extraction tools  
-   Document representation  
-   Dimensionality reduction  
-   Classifier model  
-   Semantic representation
