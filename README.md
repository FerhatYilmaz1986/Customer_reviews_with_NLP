  ### Word Embeddings:  
  When working with text in machine learning models, we need to convert strings into numbers in order to do   calculations with them. Word embeddings provides an efficent way by representing similar words with similar numbers/vectors.  
    
## NLP with Deep learning using Tensorflow/Keras  
  
## Text Classification using NLTK  
In this repository I built an algorithm to classify customer reviews and improve quality of service.   
I used Python's Pandas, NLTK and Scikit-learn libraries.  
Purpose is to design a model that predicts whether a customer liked business or not, based on their reviews.
